# General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) Algorithm

## Introduction

The General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) is a powerful algorithm for factoring large integers into their prime factors. It is based on a combination of number theory, polynomial algebra, and linear algebra and is one of the most efficient algorithms for factoring large numbers. This algorithm was first introduced in 1993 by J. Franke and E. Thom√© and has since been improved and optimized.

## Algorithm Overview

The GNFS algorithm consists of four main steps:

1. Factor n into two prime numbers p and q
2. Compute the auxiliary polynomial f(x)
3. Find a smooth relation between the prime numbers and f(x)
4. Combine the relations to obtain the factorization of n

## Implementation Details

This implementation of the GNFS algorithm uses the elliptic curve method for step 1 (factoring n into two prime numbers p and q). In step 2, the auxiliary polynomial f(x) is computed as x^2 - n. Step 3 (finding a smooth relation between the prime numbers and f(x)) uses a parallelized version of the sieve algorithm, and an optimized version of the sieve algorithm is used in step 4 (combining the relations to obtain the factorization of n) to improve efficiency.
