# High-Performance Integer Factorization: General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) and Related Algorithms

## Introduction

The General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) represents the asymptotically fastest known classical algorithm for integer factorization of large composite numbers, with a sub-exponential complexity of L[1/3, (64/9)^(1/3)] for integers exceeding approximately 10^100. This implementation provides a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous, and computationally optimized version of GNFS incorporating state-of-the-art techniques from contemporary number-theoretic research.

This repository contains a high-performance suite of integer factorization algorithms that automatically selects the asymptotically optimal method based on input magnitude:

- **Trial Division**: For integers < 10^10 (deterministic approach)
- **Quadratic Sieve (QS)**: For integers in range 10^10 to 10^30 (~30-100 bits)
- **Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS)**: For integers in range 10^30 to 10^100 (~100-330 bits)
- **General Number Field Sieve (GNFS)**: For integers > 10^100 (>330 bits)

### Computational Complexity Analysis and Practical Limitations

The asymptotic complexity characteristics of these algorithms define their practical applicability boundaries:

- **Research Applications**: Provides a rigorous platform for algorithmic number theory research, cryptanalysis studies, and computational mathematics investigations
- **Cryptographic Boundary Analysis**: Capable of factoring RSA moduli up to approximately 512 bits (154 decimal digits) with adequate computational resources
- **Computational Feasibility Threshold**: Modern RSA moduli (2048-4096 bits) remain well beyond practical factorization capabilities due to sub-exponential complexity barriers
- **Resource Requirements Scale**: Memory and computation requirements grow sub-exponentially with bit-length according to L[1/3, c] complexity

For empirical context, the factorization of RSA-768 (232 digits) required approximately 2,700 CPU-years distributed across hundreds of machines in 2009, while RSA-2048 (617 digits) would require computational resources exceeding current global capacity by several orders of magnitude (estimated at 10^11 times more difficult).

```

## Mathematical Framework and Implementation Architecture

The GNFS implementation follows a rigorous mathematical framework derived from contemporary algebraic number theory and computational number theory research:

The factorization process for large composite integers is implemented through four distinct computational phases:

2. **Relation Collection Phase**: Identifying algebraic and rational number pairs that factor completely over factor bases using lattice sieving techniques
3. **Linear Dependency Identification Phase**: Solving large sparse linear systems over GF(2) to identify dependency relationships between collected relations
4. **Algebraic Square Root Phase**: Computation of square roots in algebraic number fields to extract non-trivial integer factors

## Asymptotic Complexity-Based Algorithm Selection

The implementation automatically selects the asymptotically optimal factorization algorithm based on input magnitude:

| Algorithm | Integer Magnitude | Complexity | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| Trial Division | < 10^10 | O(N^(1/2)) | Deterministic division trial with early termination |
| Quadratic Sieve | 10^10 to 10^30 | L[1/2, 1] | Single polynomial sieving with large prime variation |
| MPQS | 10^30 to 10^100 | L[1/2, 1] | Multiple polynomial generation with self-initialization |
| GNFS | > 10^100 | L[1/3, (64/9)^(1/3)] | Number field sieve with algebraic-rational relation collection |

## Computational Performance Analysis

Performance characteristics exhibit sub-exponential scaling behavior in accordance with theoretical complexity bounds:

| Bit Length | Decimal Digits | Expected Runtime | Algorithm | Example RSA Key Size |
|------------|---------------|------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| 50         | 15            | < 1 second       | QS        | Below practical use  |
| 133        | 40            | seconds          | MPQS      | Historical (1970s)   |
| 265        | 80            | hours            | MPQS      | Historical (1980s)   |
| 400        | 120           | weeks            | GNFS      | Historical (1990s)   |
| 512        | 154           | months           | GNFS      | Legacy (pre-2000)    |
| 768        | 232           | ~2700 CPU-years  | GNFS      | Factored (2009)      |
| 1024       | 309           | ~10^7 CPU-years  | GNFS      | Legacy/Transitional  |
| 2048       | 617           | ~10^20 CPU-years | GNFS      | Current standard     |
| 4096       | 1234          | ~10^40 CPU-years | GNFS      | Extended security    |

*Note: Performance scaling follows L[1/3, c] sub-exponential complexity, resulting in approximately 3-4 orders of magnitude increase in computational difficulty for each doubling of bit length. This implementation approaches theoretical efficiency limits but remains subject to fundamental complexity barriers.*

### Memory Complexity Analysis

| Algorithm | Asymptotic Memory Complexity | Practical Implications |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| QS        | O(n), linear in bit-length   | Modest requirements for small integers |
| MPQS      | O(nÂ²), quadratic in bit-length | Moderate scaling for medium integers |
| GNFS      | L[1/3, c] â O(exp(c(log n)^(1/3)(log log n)^(2/3))) | Sub-exponential but significant growth |

For empirical reference, factoring 100-digit numbers typically requires 4-8 GB RAM, 150-digit numbers require 32-64 GB RAM, and larger factorizations exceed standard computational resources, requiring distributed memory systems or specialized hardware configurations.

### Cryptographic Security Boundary Analysis

This implementation, while representing the algorithmic state-of-the-art, operates within well-understood theoretical complexity limitations:

1. **Computational Complexity Barriers**: 
   - Contemporary RSA moduli (2048-4096 bits) maintain substantial security margins against all known classical factorization approaches

     - Custom memory hierarchies exceeding conventional architectures

3. **Fundamental Algorithmic Constraints**:
   - The General Number Field Sieve maintains L[1/3, (64/9)^(1/3)] asymptotic complexity regardless of implementation efficiency
   - Progressive optimizations yield diminishing returns against exponential difficulty scaling
   - No sub-L[1/3] classical algorithmic approach is currently known for integer factorization

The implementation demonstrates the practical boundaries of classical factorization algorithms while providing a platform for further algorithmic research. Future work may explore lattice-based sieving optimizations, advanced sparse linear algebra techniques, and potential quantum-classical hybrid approaches. Nevertheless, researchers and practitioners should maintain realistic expectations regarding computational feasibility thresholds, particularly when analyzing modern cryptographic systems with large moduli. This code systematically approaches theoretical efficiency limits while acknowledging the fundamental mathematical complexity barriers inherent in integer factorization.
